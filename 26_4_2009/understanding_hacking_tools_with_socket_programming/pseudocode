// If socket programming is not built in, then don't forget to import the needed libraries 
// We need to identify the target. This can be any ip, but I will use the local address for this example 

ipAddress = "127.0.0.1";  

// Now let's try to connect to ports on the ip address with a for loop 

for (port = 1; port < 1025; port++){
 	try {
 		socket = new Socket(ipAddress, port);
 		Write "port " + port  " on " + ipAddress + " is open";
 	} // If there is a connection, then it will let us know the port is open
 	catch(exception) {
 		Write "port " + port + " on " +ipAddress + " is closed";
 	} // If the connect fails, then the port is closed. 
}
